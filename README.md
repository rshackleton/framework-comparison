# JavaScript Framework Comparison

An attempt at a like-for-like comparison between the leading JavaScript frameworks.

```
- apps
  - web-astro
  - web-nextjs
  - web-qwik
```

Each app includes a basic "hello world" index route with no interactivity.

Additionally, each app also includes a simple interactive counter route to demonstrate basic state and interactivity.
